This is the official website for Classic Shooter Tourneys. Here you can download and see all the HTML files required for the website. This is the ONLY official website the group will use. To use the website you need to zoom out quite a bit.

# Our plan
This paper is designed to give the developers an overview of what I would like to see appearing on the website. 

The first page on the website will be a page with information about the group. It will help users navigate the website. The next page is an events tab that lists out the current events. I would like to see a section where admins can post official events and a section for user generated events. The next section will be for games. This section should list out all the games that the group plays. It should also allow users to post content that is related to the game section they are in. The next section is a forum section where users can make forum posts and have discussions. The next section will be a servers page. It will list official cst servers and servers of others that we work with. The next section is for frequently asked questions. Next is just a section for thanking those that have helped the group.

I would like to let users create accounts on the website. They should be able to sign up with just their email. 

This is the layout that I have some up with. Please post a text document in the development suggestions if you have any thoughts or changes that you would like to see.

The style of the site is currently a mess. Please submit some good screenshots you took in game to help me add better backgrounds to the site. I will also be fixing the fucked up linear gradient on the tabs and I will change them to <a> instead of <span>.

Thank you to all that are helping with the development of the website.
